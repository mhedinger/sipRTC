# sipRTC
sipRTC is a SIP over WebSockets application developed during a Master thesis of Michael Hedinger at the University of Applied Sciences HTW Chur, Switzerland.

The application aims to show a use case scenario where a federation of pharmacies in the city of Chur want to provide a WebRTC based solution to contact a pharmacy in out of office hours.
WebRTC does not regulate the signalling protocol used between peers. Hence the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) shall be used, as it is a common signalling protocol.
